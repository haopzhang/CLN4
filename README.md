# CLN4SR
A Closed-Loop Network for Single Infrared Remote Sensing Image Super-Resolution in RealWorld

Introduction
In this repository, we try to use a closed-loop network to reconstruct HR infrared remote sensing images.

Dataset
Our Dataset is collected from PROBA-V Super-Resolution competition. We divided the data into train set, val set and test set. You can download the dataset from https://kelvins.esa.int/proba-v-super-resolution/data/.
